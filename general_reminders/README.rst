Reminders v9
============
Reminder is an effective module, which helps to memorise all your important dates. We
can set reminders to any model (eg: Sales,HR,Project etc..) and also corresponding
date fields to compare. This eases the company work load to memorize the special
dates (eg: Expiration date, Deadline date, Assigned Date etc...).
